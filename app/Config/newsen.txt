Version 1.1.2 dated 4 September 2014
---------------------------------

---------------------------
Bug fixes:
- the calculation of feed distributed daily was incorrect if a distribution did not take place on a given day
- after duplicating a distribution sheet, the program refused to display the sheet being modified
Addition of features relating to distribution:
- addition of a field for indicating a 50% distribution on certain days

Version 1.0.1 dated 20 May 2014
----------------------------
Production version, including the following corrections:
- modification of a fish: it is now possible to change its category (juvenile, adult...)
- Entering distributions: feed distribution models are now sorted by name, rather than by creation date
- correction of the change of status when recording a "mortality" event
- Session duration: if no operation is performed in the application, the user is disconnected after one hour (instead of 4 previously). This is a security requirement of the RGS.
- Correction of a framework element (ObjetBDD)


Version 1.0 of 6 May 2014
-------------------------
Initial pre-production version
